# Marvel China

The rapid social-economic development achieved in China over the past 30 years has laid a sound foundation for the rise of Chinese culture. Under the "Era of Big Data", this workshop provides us an invaluable opportunity to broaden the public's horizon. By focusing on the visualization of big data, we aim at presenting our results about the quantified study on culture--the soft power in this more and more competitive world - in China from 2008 to 2014.
