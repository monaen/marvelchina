									<h3>Peking Opera</h3>
									<p align="justify">Peking Opera features dramatic plays and figures mainly by infusing four artistic skills: singing, dialogue, dancing and martial art that is symbolic and suggestive rather than realistic. Above all else, the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. There are four main roles in Beijing Opera performance, namely Sheng (men), Dan (women), Jing (painted-face role), Chou (painted-face role). Lianpu is the colorful dressing on actors' faces which is formed through dramatic artists' long-term practice and their understanding and judgment of the roles in plays.</p>

									<h3>Lion Dance</h3>
									<p align="justify">Lion dances can be broadly categorized into two styles, Northern and Southern. Both styles are commonly found in China. Northern dance was used as entertainment for the imperial court. The northern lion is usually red, orange and yellow, shaggy in appearance, with a golden head. Southern dance is more symbolic. It is usually performed as a ceremony to scare away evil spirits and to summon good luck and fortune. The southern lion exhibits various colors and has a distinctive head with large eyes, a mirror on the forehead, and a single horn at center of the head. </p>

									<h3>Pipa</h3>
									<p align="justify">The historical development of the pipa has been a progressive progress from its very beginning with few major fusions. The plucked instruments is often found in the hands of heavenly maidens depicted in traditional paintings. The pipa’s construction further epitomizes ancient Chinese belief. Its body, by traditional Chinese measurement, is three feet five inches, representing the three powers—heaven, the earth, and man, and the five elements—metal, wood, water, fire and earth. Meanwhile, the four strings represent the four seasons. Its playing technique is quite difficult—it is plucked while held upright on the knee—and it is one of the most expressive Chinese instruments.</p>

Knot weavers can use a variety of colors, but they usually weave deep red ones which signifies good fortune.</p>

									Although often called antithetical couplet, they can be described as a written form of counterpoint. The two lines have a one to one correspondence in their metrical length, and each pair of characters must have certain corresponding properties. A couplet is ideally profound yet concise, using one character per word in the style of Classical Chinese. </p>
